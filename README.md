# NLP Text Transformation Toolkit

## Overview
The NLP Text Transformation Toolkit offers a suite of Python scripts designed to perform a wide range of text transformation tasks using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. From simplifying complex texts to enhancing sentence coherence and maintaining semantic integrity, this collection provides tools for various text processing needs, including POS tagging, semantic similarity evaluation, idiom preservation, and named entity recognition. Ideal for researchers, developers, and content creators, this toolkit facilitates the creation of more accessible, coherent, and refined textual content.

## Features
- **Text Simplification:** Simplify texts for broader accessibility using synonyms and readability indices.
- **POS Tagging and Semantic Analysis:** Perform Part-Of-Speech tagging and utilise semantic similarity for targeted text transformations.
- **Sentence Rephrasing:** Leverage models like BART for advanced sentence rephrasing, ensuring content freshness and readability.
- **Coherence Enhancement:** Use GPT-2 and BERT to ensure logical flow and coherence across sentences and paragraphs.
- **Idiom and Phrasal Verb Preservation:** Detect and preserve idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs, retaining the text's nuanced meaning.
- **Named Entity Recognition:** Identify and retain named entities to preserve factual accuracy during transformations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed, along with necessary libraries like NLTK, Spacy, Gensim, and HuggingFace Transformers.
3. Navigate to the script of your choice and review its specific README for installation and usage instructions.
4. Run the script with your input text to perform the desired text transformation.
5. Review the output and adjust the script parameters as needed for optimal results.

## Usage
Each script comes with a README detailing specific usage instructions, input requirements, and configuration options. Refer to individual README files for guidance on each script's capabilities.
